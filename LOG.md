Contains a detailed record of the things I experimented with while writing this code.

* 12/24/15:
    - Tested the "fast inverse square root" from Quake for norms, but the precision I could get out of it was too awful.

* 12/22/15:
    - Just finished installing Travis CI and coveralls. Valgrind is included in the build too.
